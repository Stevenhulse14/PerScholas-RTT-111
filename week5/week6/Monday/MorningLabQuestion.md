## Question 1: Print Even Numbers Between 1 and 20

Create a function `EvenNumbers` that takes in an array that uses a loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 20.

## Question 2: Create a Function to Extract Names from User Objects

Write a JavaScript function named `extractNames` that takes an array of user objects and returns an array containing only the names of the users. Do not use Object.keys(), Object.value() to solve this problem.

### Array of User Objects

```javascript
const users = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35 },
];
```

```css
["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
```
